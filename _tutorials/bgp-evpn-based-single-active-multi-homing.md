## Implementation of BGP-EVPN based Single-Active Multi-Homing

In single-active multi-homing mode, only a single Leaf among a group of Leafs attached to a Host is allowed to forward the traffic to and from on a given VLAN.

In this post we will cover the BGP-EVPN based Single-Active Multi-Homing of CE/Hosts. Similar to Active/Active Multi-homing, Single-Active is also achieved by EVPN Ethernet Segment feature. Single-active offers redundant connectivity with forwarding for a VLAN on a single link at a time with failover to the second link in case of active link’s failure. Single-Active load balancing’s strengths arise from directing traffic to a single uplink as opposed to all-active's approach of ECMP-hashing. This approach is very useful for network scenarios where policing, metering and billing are required.  

## Reference Topology:
![](https://github.com/xrdocs/ncs5500/blob/gh-pages/images/evpn-config/reference-topology-evpn-single-active.png?raw=true)

For this post, we will leverage EVPN control-plane and ISIS Segment Routing based forwarding that we configured in a previous [post.]({{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/bgp-evpn-configuration-ncs-5500-part-1/)

![](https://github.com/xrdocs/ncs5500/blob/gh-pages/images/evpn-config/single-active-multi-homing.png?raw=true)

As shown in the above topology, Host-1 is multi-homed to Leaf-1 and Leaf-2. For EVPN single-active multi-homing, each link towards the Leaf will be in a unique ethernet bundle interface. VLAN 10 and 20 are allowed on both the ethernet-bundles. As both the links are in separate ethernet bundles, the host H-1 will flood traffic at first to both the Leafs but only the Ethernet-Segment's Designated Forwarder (DF) Leaf will forward the traffic. As a result, the host will have only one ethernet bundle interface in its forwarding table to forward the traffic and achieve per VLAN single-active multi-homing. 

### Task 1: Configure Ethernet bundles on Host-1 for multi-homing

As per the reference topology Host-1 is multi-homed to Leaf-1 and Leaf-2 via LACP bundle-ethernet 11 going to Leaf-1 and bundle-ethernet 12 going to Leaf-2. ASR9K is acting as the host/CE with IP address 10.0.0.10/24 configured on a BVI. Following is the configuration of LAG on Host-1.  

The LAG on Host-1 will come up after we configure single-active multi-homing using EVPN Ether-Segment on the Leaf-1 and Leaf-2.

**Note:** In this post we will configure VLAN 10 to show the single-active behavior. Configuration of VLAN 20 is out of scope for this post but follows the same procedure.

### Task 2: Configure EVPN based single-active multi-homing

Configure Leaf-1 and Leaf-2 to provision single-active multi-homing to host-1. The set of links from Host-1 to the Leafs will be configured as Ethernet Segment on the Leafs.

![](https://github.com/xrdocs/ncs5500/blob/gh-pages/images/evpn-config/ethernet-segment-single-active-multi-homing.png?raw=true)

Configure the bundles on the Leaf-1 and Leaf-2. Use below configuration for the Leafs.
**Note:** For single-active multi-homing, the LACP System MAC address should not be configured on ethernet bundle interface.

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
Leaf-1:

interface TenGigE0/0/0/47
 description "Link to Host-1" 
 bundle id 11 mode active
!
interface Bundle-Ether 11
 description "Bundle to Host-1"
!

Leaf-2

interface TenGigE0/0/0/47
 description "Link to Host-1" 
 bundle id 12 mode active
!
interface Bundle-Ether 12
 description "Bundle to Host-1"
!
</code>
</pre>
</div>

Configure Ethernet Segment id (ESI) for the bundle interface to enable multi-homing of the host. Use the identical ethernet-segment configuration on both the Leafs, though the ethernet-bundle interface is different for both Leafs. Configure load-balancing mode to single-active using “single-active” keyword for ethernet-segment.  

**Note:** Single-active mode is the default for Physical interfaces and no extra configuration to enable single-active is required.

Use “show bundle bundle-ether <bundle-id>” CLI command to verify the state of the bundle interface on Leafs and Host-1.

Above output shows that the bundle interfaces are up. Next, lets provision the EVPN layer-2 service. 


### Task 3: Configure BGP EVPN based layer-2 multipoint service
Configure the EVPN layer-2 service between Leaf-1, Leaf-2 and Leaf-5 and then check the status of ethernet segment. For detailed explanation of configuring BGP EVPN based layer-2 service, refer to this [post.]({{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/bgp-evpn-configuration-ncs-5500-part-3/)

In the above output we can observe that Leaf-1 has bundle-ethernet 11 and Leaf-2 has bundle-ethernet 12 in ‘Up’ state. Both have two next-hops, one being the Leaf itself and the second next-hop is the peer-leaf/PE. Operational state of the ethernet-segment is multi-homed with single-active load-balancing. 

The output of both the Leafs show that both are forwarders of 1 subnet (10.0.0.x/24 in our case), while Leaf-1 is elected as Designated Forwarder (DF) and Leaf-2 is the non-DF. This means that any Uniccast and BUM traffic that comes to Leaf-2 will not be forwarded and only Leaf-1 being the DF will forward it. 

Ping from Host-1 to Host-5 shows that the hosts are reachable.

Let’s take a look at the BGP EVPN control-plane to verify that only Leaf-1 being the designated-forwarder for EVI 10 is advertising itself the next-hop and Leaf-2 is not announcing any MAC addresses related to EVI 10. This is due to the fact that for single-active load-balancing only one Leaf-1 should advertise the reachability. 

In the below output from Leaf-5 we can see the MAC address of Host-1 is learnt from Leaf-1 (rd 1.1.1.1:10) in a route-type 2 advertisement. As we look at Leaf-2’s route distinguishers (rd 2.2.2.2:10) we see that no MAC address is advertised for EVI 10. This verifies that only Leaf-1 will be programmed in Leaf-5 as the next-hop to reach to Host-1.

Lastly, run “show evpn evi vpn-id 10 mac” command to verify the MAC address learnt for EVI 10. We see that Leaf-1 and Leaf-2 have learnt Host-5’s MAC address with Leaf-5 as the next-hop.

As we observe Leaf-5’s output, we see that the Leaf-5 has programmed Leaf-1 as the only next-hop for Host-1’s MAC address reachability, although Host-1 is multi-homed to both Leaf-1 and Leaf-2. This verifies that single-active dual-homing is operational and that at one time only one Leaf will forward the traffic to and from the Host for a given EVI.  

**Note:** As Leaf-2 sees Host-1's MAC reachable via Leaf-1, in case of another Host/ESI connected to Leaf-2 wants to reach to Host-1 it will have to go over Leaf-1 to reach to Host-1.

### Task 5: Configure the BGP-EVPN Distributed Anycast Gateway for inter-subnet routing
For Layer-3 inter-subnet routing use case; similar to Host-1’s layer-2 reachability, Host-1’s IP will also only be reachable via Leaf-1 as next-hop. After we configure BGP-EVPN distributed anycast gateway for inter-subnet routing, we will observe the routing table of Leaf-5.

Configure the BGP-EVPN Distributed Anycast Gateway on Leaf-1, Leaf-2 and Leaf-5. For detailed explanation of distributed anycast gateway, refer to this [post.]( {{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/bgp-evpn-irb-configuration/)

Configure the static route on Host-1 and Host-5 to reach to the default gateway on Leafs.

As we have now configured the BGP-EVPN distributed anycast gateway on Leafs, lets observe the routing table of Leaf-5. The below output shows that Host-1's IP 10.0.0.10/32 is reachable via only Leaf-1. 
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
Leaf-5:
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Leaf-5#show route vrf 10

B    <mark>10.0.0.10/32 [200/0] via 1.1.1.1</mark> (nexthop in vrf default), 00:46:13

Finally we can observe in the ARP table output of Leaf-1 and Leaf-2 that the ARP entry for Host-1 is only programmed on Leaf-1. This is becuase of the single-active behavior of ethernet-segment and Leaf-1 being the designated-forwarder. This concludes the BGP-EVPN single-active implementation, for further technical details refer to our [e-vpn.io](http://e-vpn.io/) webpage that has a lot of material explaining the core concepts of EVPN, its operations and troubleshooting.
