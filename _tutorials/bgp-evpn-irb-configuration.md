EVPN Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) feature allows end hosts across the overlay to communicate with each other within or across the subnets in the VPN. In this post we will cover the implementation of EVPN IRB to route between Host-1 and Host-9. Distributed Anycast Gateway will be configured on Leaf-1 and Leaf-2 for subnet 10.0.0.0/24 and on Leaf-5 for subnet 20.0.0.0/24. 
After configuring IRB we will ping between the Host-1 and Host-9 to verify the reachability and observe the routes are learnt vie BGP EVPN. 

In [last post]({{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/bgp-evpn-configuration-ncs-5500-part-3/) we configured the Layer-2 stretch between Leaf-1, Leaf-2 and Leaf-5 using BGP EVPN EVI 10 for VLAN 10. We don’t need VLAN 10 on Leaf-5 for this post, that is why EVI 10 and related Bridge Domain is removed from Leaf-5.

## Reference Topology:

### Task 1: Configure the BGP-EVPN Distributed Anycast Gateway on Leaf-1 and Leaf-2  
BGP EVPN provides Distributed anycast gateway feature that enables any Leaf in the fabric to serve as the active default gateway for a host in a subnet. Same virtual gateway IP address and virtual MAC address is configured on the BVI interface for each subnet across the Leafs enabling them to act as gateway for their locally connected hosts. Distributed anycast gateway brings the advantage of seamless workload mobility. 

![](https://github.com/xrdocs/ncs5500/blob/gh-pages/images/evpn-config/evpn-irb-full-topology.png?raw=true)

We will configure the GW BVI on the Leafs inside the VRF for this post, however we can also configure the BVI in the global routing table.  
  
A virtual routing and forwarding instance VRF, represents a tenant. This VRF will have the routes that belong to the overlay network for that tenant. The route-target values should be configured for the VRF to define which prefixes are exported and imported on the Leafs. As we will configure BVI under VRF, the related show commands and troubleshooting should point to the VRF.

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
Configure VRF 10 on Leaf-1, Leaf-2 and Leaf-5

      vrf 10
       address-family ipv4 unicast
        import route-target
         10:10
        !
        export route-target
         10:10
       !

Use “show vrf 10” to verify the config.
</code>
</pre>
</div> 

Configure the VRF in BGP to advertised the routes of the VRF to other Leafs. Initiate the VPNv4 address family to advertise VRF label. RD auto under VRF generates RD value automatically based on **[BGP-Router-ID:EVI-ID]**. However, configuring RD manually is also supported.  
We will use “redistribute connected” under VRF to advertise connected routes via BGP. In addition, we are configuring BGP multipathing for load balancing where multiple next-hops are available for a prefix. 

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
Configure the following on Leaf-1, Leaf-2 and Leaf-5

      router bgp 65001
       <mark>address-family vpnv4 unicast</mark>
       !
       vrf 10
        rd auto

         maximum-paths ibgp 10
         redistribute connected
      !
</code>
</pre>
</div>

Now, we will configure the BVI-10 on Leaf-1 and Leaf-2 under VRF 10. The BVI will serve as the Distributed Anycast GW for subnet 10.0.0.0/24. Make sure the BVI IP address and MAC address are identical on Leaf-1 and Leaf-2. Configure "host-routing" under BVI interface to advertise route-type 2. 

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
      interface BVI 10
       host-routing

       mac-address <mark>1001.1001.1001</mark>
      !
</code>
</pre>
</div>

In order for the BVI interface to come up and serve as the gateway to the host connected to the Leaf, we will have to configure the host connectivity to the Leaf _(this is already configured in_ [post-2]({{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/bgp-evpn-configuration-ncs-5500-part-2/) _and_ [post-3]({{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/bgp-evpn-configuration-ncs-5500-part-3/)_)_. Also associate the BVI to a Bridge-Domain.

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">

Associate the BVI to a Bridge-Domain and add the Host's attachment circuit to the Bridge Domain. The BVI will come up once the host connectivity to the Leaf is configured. For Host's connectivity, configure layer-2 interface with dot1q encapsulation for VLAN 20 on Leaf-5.

Configure EVI under EVPN config on Leaf-5 to create EVPN service for VLAN 20. This EVI 20 will then be associated to the Bridge-Domain for VLAN 20. Assign the route-target values for the EVI to import and export prefixes via BGP EVPN control-plane.  
In the below configuration route-target is manually configured, however route-target can be automatically generated as well, based on [BGP-AS]:[EVI-ID].

Lets check the host reachability by pinging from Host-1 (IP 10.0.0.10/32) to Host-9 (IP 20.0.0.50/32).  
In the below output we can see that we can ping between the Host-1 (IP 10.0.0.10) and Host-9 (IP 20.0.0.50) successfully which are both on different subnets.

We can verify the routes advertisement using the BGP EVPN control-plane. In the below output from Leaf-5 we can see the MAC and IP address of Host-1 are learnt under their respective route distinguishers via EVPN Route-Type-2.

Example of Host-1 MAC+IP learnt via Route-Type-2 **([2][0][48][6c9c.ed6d.1d8b][32][10.0.0.10]/136)**

The route distinguisher value is comprised of **[BGP-Router-ID:EVI-ID] eg**. for **Leaf-1: 1.1.1.1:10, Leaf-2: 2.2.2.2:10**.

When a host is discovered through ARP, the MAC and IP Route Type 2 is advertised with both Bridge-Domain/EVI label and IP VRF label with their respective route-targets. The VRF route-targets and IP VPN labels are associated with Route Type-2 to achieve Leaf-Leaf IP routing similar to traditional L3VPNs. For Layer-2 forwarding between Leaf-Leaf, the Bridge-Domain/EVI route-targets and labels associated with the Route Type 2 are used.  
In the below output on Leaf-5 for the prefix learnt from Leaf-1 (RD 1.1.1.1:10), we can see the highlighted route-target and label values.

Lets check the routing table of VRF 10 on the Leafs. In below output we can see that 10.0.0.10/32 and 20.0.0.50/32 prefixes are being learnt on the Leafs.

Lastly, we verify the CEF table for Host-1's prefix (10.0.0.10/32) on Leaf-5. We can see that we have ECMP paths available to reach to Host-1 and BGP multipathing is operational.

After the configuration and verifcation we are able to perform inter-subnet routing between Host-1 and Host-5. This was achieved with BGP EVPN Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) feature along with Distributed Anycast Gateway. For deep dive details of BGP EVPN, refer to our **[e-vpn.io](https://e-vpn.io/)** webpage, it has a lot of material explaining the core concepts of EVPN, its operations and troubleshooting details.
