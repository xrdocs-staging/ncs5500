## Introduction
The Cisco NCS 5500 Series Modular Platforms offers industry-leading 100 GbE and 400 GbE port density to handle massive traffic growth. Latest trends in the Metro Architecture have driven the evolution of the product portfolio. Starting XR release 7.0.2 , the NC57 Line Cards are introduced in the platform to support higher speed and flexible scalablity. With IOS-XR 7.10.1, two new variants of line cards are introduced _viz._ NC57-48Q2D-S and NC57-48Q2D-SE-S, bringing highly scalable dense low speed line card to the family of NCS 5700 modular line card.

## NC57 Series  Modular Line Cards for NCS 55xx Chassis
The NC57 Series Line Cards brought the support for 400G with enhanced scalability in the NCS 5500 Modular Chassis Family. The family of line card now offers speed range starting from 1G to 400G at unmatched scalability and functionality. The table below summarises the NC57 series line card family as of today.

## NC57-48Q2D Line Card Specification

The new NCS5700 line card variants are built to bring in dense low speed variant to the fold. The NC57-48Q2D-(SE)-S line card is comprised of multirate SFP28, SFP56 & QSFP56-DD ports. The 32xSFP28 ports can work at 1/10/25G, the 16xSFP56 ports can work at 1/10/25/50G and the 2xQDD ports work at 40/100/200/400G with Breakout support.

_Figure 2: NC57-48Q2D-(SE)-S Line Card Ports view

`Note: 1G support on the SFP56 will be availble later release`

### Front Panel Ports and Speed
The NC57-48Q2D line card is built to serve as a dense low speed aggregation line card and the very first line card in NCS 5700 modular family to support native 1G. All the front panel ports are multirate in nature and the speed ranges from 1G to 400G. 

#### SFP28 Ports
As described in _Figure 2_, the first 32 ports (P0 to P31) are of SFP28 form factor and work at 1/10/25G speed. By default, ports comes up as 25G and the speed can be changed with controller optics command per port. 

#### SFP56 Ports
The next 16 ports (P32 to P47) can support a speed upto 50G. These are true multirate port capabale of supporting 1/10/25/50G. 

`Note: 1G support on the SFP56 will be availble later release`

#### QSFP56DD Ports
Apart from the low speed SFP form factors, the line card variant is also equipped with 2 Nos. of QSFP56DD ports supporting upto 400G. The ports are backward compitable with QSFP+/QSFP28 and support 40G/100G, 200G and breakout options.


### Internal Architecture

![vigor-ls-block.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/vigor-ls-block.png)
_Figure 3: NC57-48Q2D-S/NC57-48Q2D-SE-S Building Blocks_

The NC57-48Q2D-(SE)-S line card is built with single J2C ASIC and offers a massive throughput of 2.4 Tbps/1BPPS. The scaled variant of the line card, NC57-48Q2D-SE-S comes with OP2 external TCAM that assists in achieveing higher prefix and service scale. All the front panel ports of the line cards are connected to network IFs of the NPU via PHY element which works as retimer to set interface speeds and also enables MACsec capability on all the ports. 

The first set of 32 SFP28 ports are coming from 32 set of 25GE NIF on the ASIC via 2x PHY elements. The next set of 16xSFP56 ports are also connected via 2xPHY element , each taking 16x25GE NIF line and connecting 8xSFP56 ports at the faceplate. Thus each individual port works at 1/10/25/50G multirate. 

The QSFP-DD ports take out 16x50GE NIF and each group of 8x50GE NIF is converted to one QDD 400G port at the faceplate. This is a true multirate port and natively works at 40/100/200/400G speed. It can be also used in various breakout mode combination.

### Port Speeds &  Breakouts Options

By default, the NC57-48Q2D-(SE)-S line cards comes up as an 32x25G+16x50G+2x400G line card. following snippet shows the default port speeds.

The speeds of each port can be set individully using the controller optics configuration. Different supported breakout modes are also configured under the controller optics configuration for the QDD ports.

On the NC5748Q-2D series line cards, port speeds are reset based on inserted optics as well. For example, when 1G SFP is inserted on the SFP28 ports or a 10G or 25G optics is inserted in the SFP 56 ports, the corresponding  ports will be set to a GigabitE or TenGE or TwentyFiveGE port respectively. However, it is best practice to configure the speed manually, as the reset doesn't happen after removing the optics from the port.

### MACsec & Timing
The NC57-48Q2D series line card supports MACsec encryption on all the ports. This is achieved by the use of the PHY element. The following table summarizes MACsec support at different port speed for the type of ports.

| SFP 28 ports 0-31 | SPF56 ports 32-47 | QDD56 Ports 48,49|
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
|1G, 10G,25G | 10G, 25G, 50G | 4x10G/40G/4x25G/100G/2x100G/4x100G/400G|

`Note: 1G MAcsec support on the SFP56 ports (32-47) are not available in the initail release and`

This line card variants can support industry standard class C timing on all the ports when the modular chassis is equiped with NC55-RP2-E card. 

`Note that Class-C timing support on J2 Native mode is in software roadmap`


## Scalability & Use Cases

The new dense low speed line card comes with high scalability and powered with the flexibility of [MDB Profiles]({{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/mdb-ncs5700/). By default, in J2 Native the base line card runs L3MAX and the scale line card runs L3MAX-SE profile. Since we are talking about modular platform, -SE profile is usefull when all the line card in the system are eTCAM variants. The table below summarizes supported MDB profiles for the line card variants.

| LC variant | L3MAX| L3MAX-SE| L2MAX | L2MAX-SE|
|-----------|-------|---------|-------|---------|
|NC57-48Q2D-S| <mark>Yes</mark>  | No      | Yes   | No      |
|NC57-48Q2D-SE-S|Yes  | <mark>Yes</mark>     | Yes   | yes     |

With L3max-SE profile, NC57-48Q2D-SE-S  can hold up to 5M IPv4 or 3M IPv6 prefixes. Also, the presence of eTCAM on this card enables additional features, e.g. BGP-Flow spec, strict uRPF  etc.

## Summary & References

With the addition of the NC57-48Q2D line cards to the existing portfolio of 400G, 100G and modular line cards, the NCS 5500 modular systems can be deployed in a diverse set of use cases and unleash the full power of Jericho 2 native mode.
