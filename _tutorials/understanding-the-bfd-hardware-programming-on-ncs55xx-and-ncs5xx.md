## Introduction

In our previous [article]({{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/bfd-architecture-on-ncs5500-and-ncs500/), we discussed the BFD feature in the pipeline architecture (NCS55xx and NCS5xx). We discussed how the packet flow and the hardware resources are utilised. We saw how the scale is considered for the BFD feature and how well the resources have been carved to achieve the desired numbers. In this article, we will go a bit deeper in the BFD. We will see a sample configuration, and see how to read the BFD outputs (as per RFC 5880) and check the hardware programming.

## Quick Refresh ([RFC 5880](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5880))

As discussed in the previous article, the goal of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is to provide low-overhead, short-duration detection of failures in the path between adjacent forwarding engines, including the interfaces, data link(s), and, to the extent possible, the forwarding engines themselves. An additional goal is to provide a single mechanism that can be used for liveness detection over any media, at any protocol layer, with a wide range of Detection Times and overhead, to avoid a proliferation of different methods.

### BFD Control Packet Format

Let us look at the BFD control packet format briefly. This will be useful in understanding the CLI outputs and the messages being exchanged between 2 nodes.

Apart from the above fields, we also have the optional Authentication section. For details please [refer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5880).

### BFD State Machine

![Screenshot 2021-05-11 at 2.24.16 PM.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot 2021-05-11 at 2.24.16 PM.png)

As per the [RFC 5880](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5880), the BFD state machine is quite straightforward.  There are three states through which a session normally proceeds: two for establishing a session : **Init and Up**. And one for tearing down a session: **Down**. This allows a three-way handshake for both session establishment and session teardown, assuring that both systems are aware of all session state changes.  A fourth state **AdminDown** exists so that a session can be administratively put down indefinitely. Each system communicates its session state in the State (Sta) field in the BFD Control packet.

| State           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Down state      | This state means that the session is down or has just been created. <br>A session remains in Down state until the remote system indicates that it agrees that the session is down by sending a BFD Control packet with the State field set to anything other than Up.                                                                    |
| Init state      | This state means that the remote system is communicating, and the local system desires to bring the session up, but the remote system does not yet realize it.  <br>A session will remain in Init state until either a BFD Control Packet is received that is signalling Init or Up state in which case the session advances to Up state |
| Up state        | This state means that the BFD session has successfully been established, and implies that connectivity between the systems is working. <br>The session will remain in the Up state until either connectivity fails or the session is taken down administratively.                                                                        |
| AdminDown state | This state means that the session is being held administratively down.  <br>This causes the remote system to enter Down state, and remain there until the local system exits AdminDown state                                                                                                                                             |

## Configuring a simple BFD session (NCS55xx and NCS5xx)

After a quick refresh of the theory behind the BFD packets, let us get into the routers and check it practically. We will take a simple example and walk through the hardware programming. 

![Screenshot 2021-05-12 at 11.31.43 AM.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot 2021-05-12 at 11.31.43 AM.png)

In this example, we have configured OSPF between R1 and R2 and used BFD on the physical interface. The BFD configurations are configured under the physical interface.

**R1 (NCS-55A2-MOD-HD-S)**

```
router ospf 1
 router-id 172.16.3.26
 address-family ipv4 unicast
 area 0
  !
  interface TenGigE0/0/0/12
   bfd minimum-interval 300
   bfd fast-detect
   bfd multiplier 3
   network point-to-point
  !
```

**R2 (N540-24Z8Q2C-M)**

```
router ospf 1
 router-id 172.16.3.18
 address-family ipv4 unicast
 area 0
  !
  interface TenGigE0/0/0/12
   bfd minimum-interval 300
   bfd fast-detect
   bfd multiplier 3
   network point-to-point
  !
```

## Verification

Let us verify a few CLI commands and confirm the hardware programming. This command gives a quick information of all the sessions configured.

![Screenshot 2021-05-24 at 7.15.15 PM.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot 2021-05-24 at 7.15.15 PM.png)

The below command gives a detailed output of the different parameters of the BFD control packet which we mentioned in the earlier section. We can see the source and destination values, the version, state, discriminator values and different flags being set or clear. We can also see the hardware offloaded information and values. The state of the session is showing UP which indicates the programming in the hardware is done properly. If there is any programming issue, we will see the state stuck in admin down or init. Another important value to check in the output is _Async Session ID_ and _Async Tx Key_. In case of hardware programming issues the value of the key would be **0**.

The hardware programming in the OAM engine can also be verified with the below command. The _Async Session ID_ can be used to get the output. It clearly mentions that the BFD is processed in the OAM engine and not in the CPU. Other hardware values programmed are also matching.

## Packet Captures

Let us examine the packet capture of the control packets being exchanged between the routers. Below is the packet capture of the received parameters from the remote peer. We can verify that the values are matching with the CLI outputs we captured in the earlier commands

## Timer Negotiations

Let us change the minimum timer and the multiplier value one end and see how the timer values are negotiated.

R1 has a minimum time interval value of 300ms. R2 has minimum time interval value of 100ms. What will be the negotiated timer value ? Will the session go down. Let us verify.

We can see the higher timer value is negotiated
 
## Configuring ISIS as a client for the same interface

After configuring the ISIS between the routers and configuring BFD on the interface, we can see that the BFD session will remain 1 but the clients will now show ospf and isis

So we saw a couple of examples of configuring the OSPF and ISIS as clients of BFD. The clients are not just restricted to OSPF and IS-IS. We support many other clients. For details on how to configure different clients like BGP, pim, BFD on sub interface please [refer](https://community.cisco.com/t5/service-providers-blogs/bfd-over-ipv4-implementation-on-ncs5500-platform/ba-p/3825926). In the netx artcile we will also cover the BFD w.r.t bundles and touch upon the concepts of BLB and BoB.


## Summary

Hope this article helped you to understand the hardware programming of the BFD in the pipeline architecture. This can be used for a basic configuration and debugging before reaching out to Cisco TAC :). In the next arcticle we will try to explore the concepts of BLB/BOB/BVI and its hardware implementation.
