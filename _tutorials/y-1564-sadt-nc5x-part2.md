## Overview

In [Previous Article]({{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/y-1564-sadt-nc5x-part1/) we looked at the Y.1564 concepts and example configuration to run a Y.1564 Service Activation Test on NCS 5500 and NCS 500 routers. In this part, we will explore more capabilities such as color aware test and their application.

## Y.1564 Color Profile
An ethernet service activation test can be either color aware or color blind. By default, a test is color blind and only a single flow is generated at a rate configured in the information rate. The color aware mode is distinguished by use of a different COS marking. This different COS identifies the Excess Information Rate (EIR) flow. The committed flow uses the COS value provided in the “outer-COS” and “inner-COS” configuration. In a color aware flow, the EIR flow that is generated might have the discard eligibility indicator (DEI) set (dei =1). By default, it is not set (dei=0). The Committed information rate (CIR) needs to be configured for color-aware mode and EIR is obtained from the difference of information rate (IR) and committed information rate (CIR).

The line `color-aware cir 700 mbps eir-color cos 0`  in the SADT profile denotes that this is a color aware profile. The committed information rate (CIR) is specified in the same configuration line. The excess information rate (EIR) is obtained from the difference of information rate (IR) and the CIR . When traffic is generated, traffic within CIR is marked with the outer-cos value in profile, traffic exceeding CIR profile is marked with the eir-color cos. 

There are certain restriction on cos values that can be used in an color aware Service Activation Profile shown in the below table:

`Note: Color aware profile needs the cos values to be preserved in the packets. Therefore, color aware Service Activation Test  can’t be supported if we have pop operation configured on the attachment circuits (EFPs)`

## Y.1564 Color Aware Profile Configuration 

### Color aware profile without DEI bit

The Profile Generates traffic at 500 Mbps and a CIR of 300 Mbps. The CIR traffic is marked with COS value of 4. The EIR is 200 Mbps (500-200) and EIR traffic is marked with COS value of 3. The following figures shows the snapshot of generated traffic.

This profile generates traffic at 500 Mbps with a CIR if 300 Mbps.  The CIR traffic is marked with COS value of 1. The EIR here is 200 Mbps (500- 300) and EIR traffic is marked with COS 0 and DEI bit for EIR traffic is also set to 1. The following figures shows the snapshot of generated traffic.

## Application: Validating Color Aware/Multi-CoS Bandwidth Profile

In this section, we will explore the application of  color aware traffic generation to validate a point-to-point L2 service with a multi COS bandwidth profile. The color aware profile uses two different COS values to generate a CIR and EIR flow. It can be used to validate a service where a color aware or a multi-COS policer is enforced 

### Scenario: 
A 500 Mbps point-to-point circuit needs to be provisioned with a multi COS bandwidth profile. Both the traffic classes are identified by COS value of 4 and 3. COS 4 has a committed rate of 300 Mbps and peak up to 500 Mbps, similarly COS 3 has a committed rate of 200 Mbps and peak  up to 500 Mbps. Total traffic is committed at 500 Mbps and peak rate is also 500 Mbps. This is achieved using a conform-aware hierarchical BWP where parent has a 500 Mbps CIR and PIR policer. The child classes have their individual policer with CIR of 300 and 200 Mbps respectively. Peak-rate for both child is 500 Mbps. The objective is to check if Committed rate is met for both child classes when total traffic rate matching both class cross 500 Mbps.

### Solution: 
Once the circuit and QoS all are in place, the service can be validated using a color aware   SADT profile. We can leverage the CIR and EIR flows to simultaneously check traffic from both class. We will generate same rate of traffic for both flows (1Gbps each) and check if cos4 is limited to 300 and cos3 is limited to 200 Mbps. Individual class peak-rate can be validated by simply using color blind profiles.

The color aware profile used to validate the BWP is generating IR at 2 Gbps (1Gbps CIR & 2-1=1Gbps EIR). The expectation is we would see 70% loss for CIR and 80% loss for the EIR streams. To validate individual class can peak upto 500 Mbps, color blind profile is used at 2 Gbps and expected FLR is 75%.

### SADT Result

Now, we start the service activation test on the UNI interface. The loopback is enabled on the remote UNI in internal direction. From below results, we see that both during the test and after the test the cumulative traffic loss for class green (CIR, COS 4) is 70% which means 300 Mbps traffic is flowing through the circuit. For EIR it is 80% FLR meaning 200 Mbps is guaranteed.

`Note: The remote PE must enable a MAC swap loop for correct SADT statistics. EDPL functionality can be used on Cisco NCS devices for this.`

As we see from above results Committed rate for both service is met. The FLR of ~70% and 80% for the CIR and EIR flows mean a throughput of 300 Mbps and 200 Mbps for the CoS 4 and CoS 3 respectively.   
The below output for the color blind profile can validate that individually, the CoS 4  class can reach a peak-rate of 500 Mbps. The test is run on ideal scenario and the FLR of 75% on 2 Gbps IR indicates that a throughput of 500 Mbps is achieved.

In Both of the test result there is out of order packets which is expected as OOO is flagged if a recieved packet sequence is different from the expected sequence and it is bound to happen when some of the generated packets are loss due to QoS enforecment.
