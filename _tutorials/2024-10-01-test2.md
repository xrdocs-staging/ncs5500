<div class="notice--info">
  <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Run by a CPU process at application level.</li>
    <li>Easy to use with a similar syntax across different platforms.</li>
    <li>Often very verbose, and sometimes not very granular.</li>
    <li>Display data, very specific to a given process.</li>
    <li>Require a valid trigger to display a debug message.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
