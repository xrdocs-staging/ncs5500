## Introduction

In our [previous article]({{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/access-list-enhancements-on-ncs5500-j2-based-platforms/), we discussed the ACL enhancements on the newer generation NCS5500 plaforms. In this article we will discuss some more enhancements w.r.t ACLs, which we have done in IOS-XR 7.6.1

## IOS-XR 7.6.1 Enhancements

In IOS-XR 7.6.1, we have brought in a number of new enhancements when it comes to ACLs. 
 - Increased Ingress ACLs
 - ACL Chaining with ACL Based Forwarding (ABF)
 - Enable Ingress Interface Logging on ACE
 - ACL-Based Policing

We will discuss about each enhancement in details

## Increased Ingress ACLs


In earlier releases, we could configure maximum upto 127 different traditional ingress ACLs and 255 different hybrid ingress ACLs in shared ACL mode per line card. From IOS-XR 7.6.1 we can now configure an increased number of either traditional (non-compression) or hybrid (compression) ingress ACLs in shared ACL mode, as listed below:

 - A maximum of 512 different traditional ingress ACLs per line card.
 - A maximum of 1000 different hybrid ingress ACLs per line card.

Increased ACLs provide you with enhanced traffic filtering capabilities to control how traffic packets move through the network and restrict the access of users and devices to the network. For further deepdive please follow the [link](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/ncs5500/ip-addresses/76x/b-ip-addresses-cg-ncs5500-76x/m-implementing-access-lists-prefix-lists-ncs5500.html#id_63255). 

### Support Matrix 

| Platforms                      | Support |
|--------------------------------|---------|
| NCS5500 without eTCAM (J/J+)   | No      |
| NCS5500 with eTCAM (J/J+)      | No      |
| NCS5700 without eTCAM (J2/J2C) | Yes     |
| NCS5700 with eTCAM (J2/J2C)    | Yes     |


## ACL Chaining with ACL Based Forwarding (ABF)

Prior to IOS-XR 7.6.1, ABF and ACL chaining with Common ACL were mutually exclusive features. From 7.6.1 onwards, we can enable ABF in conjunction with ACL chaining in Common ACL. With this feature, the router can inspect and forward the packets based on the ABF rule in Common ACL. For further deepdive, please follow the links for [Chained ACL]({{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/chained-acl-for-ncs55xx-and-ncs5xx/) and [ABF]({{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/acl-based-forwarding-and-object-tracking-for-ncs5xx-and-ncs55xx/).

## Enable Ingress Interface Logging on ACE

NCS5500 product family already supports logging messages about packets permitted or denied by IP access list. That is, any packet that matches the access list causes an informational logging message about the packet. The level of messages logged to the console is controlled by the logging console command in global configuration mode. The first packet that triggers the access list causes an immediate logging message, and subsequent packets are collected over 5-minute intervals before they are displayed or logged. ([Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/ncs5500/ip-addresses/76x/b-ip-addresses-cg-ncs5500-76x/m-implementing-access-lists-prefix-lists-ncs5500.html#con_1063757)). Let us verify the behaviour on the router.

We have a router with ACL configured with logging enabled.

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:N57B1-1-Vega-II5-57#show access-lists ipv4 acl_log 
ipv4 access-list acl_log
 10 permit icmp host 172.16.0.57 host 172.16.0.53 <mark>log</mark>
 20 permit icmp host 172.16.0.53 host 172.16.0.57 <mark>log</mark>
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:N57B1-1-Vega-II5-57#
</code>
</pre>
</div>

When we hit a ACE, we see the below in the syslogs 

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:N57B1-1-Vega-II5-57#RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Apr 19 09:00:41.213 UTC: ipv4_acl_mgr[162]: %ACL-IPV4_ACL-6-IPACCESSLOGDP : <mark>access-list acl_log (20) permit icmp 172.16.0.53 -> 172.16.0.57 (8/0), 4406 packets</mark> 
</code>
</pre>
</div>

If we do not specify the log keyword we would not have received this particular syslogs in the console. This gives us better readability of the syslogs as compared to no logging option.

You can control the number of packets that, when they match an access list (and are permitted or denied), cause the system to generate a log message. You might do this to receive log messages more frequently than at 5-minute intervals. The below command helps to achieve the same

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:N57B1-1-Vega-II5-57(config)#ipv4 access-list log-update threshold ?
  <1-2147483647>  Log update threshold (number of hits)
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:N57B1-1-Vega-II5-57(config)#ipv4 access-list log-update threshold
```

Note: The similar is applicable for IPv6 Access-list as well.
{: .notice--info}

From IOS-XR 7.6.1, we have enhanced the logging feature for the ACL to give more readability to the users. We have introduced the keyword **log-input**. This is an optional keyword and it provides the same functionality as the log keyword, as described above, except that the log-message also includes the ingress interface on which the router receives the packet. The router supports this feature for both IPv4 and IPv6 ingress ACLs on:
 - Physical Interfaces
 - Sub-interfaces and 
 - Bridged-virtual interfaces (BVI)
 - Bundle Interfaces
 
 Whenever a permit/deny ACE is hit we get a syslog which also mentions the interface details 
 
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>

RP/0/RP0/CPU0:N57B1-1-Vega-II5-57#show access-lists ipv4 acl_log 
ipv4 access-list acl_log
 10 permit icmp host 172.16.0.57 host 172.16.0.53 log-input
 20 permit icmp host 172.16.0.53 host 172.16.0.57 log-input

</code>

## ACL-Based Policing

Prior to IOS-XR 7.6.1, ACLs could only permit or deny packets based on the matching criteria. From IOS-XR 7.6.1, users can control the traffic that an access control entry (ACE) allows in the ingress direction by configuring the policing rate for the ACE in an IPv4 or IPv6 Hybrid ACL. This functionality limits packet rates and takes different actions for different packets. This feature brings in simplicity for traffic policing as users do not have to configure a QoS policy for the same. 

### Feature support 

 - It is supported only in the ingress direction
 - It is supported only with hybrid ACL
 - It is supported only on J2/J2C based NCS5700 with external TCAM 
 - It is supported only on chassis operating in native mode
 - Both IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs are supported with policing
 - It i supported only with permit criteria
 - Policing rate in PPS is not supported 
 - L2 ACL is not supported for policing

### Configurations

Let us verify the feature functionality. We have a NCS5700 router with IOS-XR 7.6.1 with next with external TCAM operating in native mode. We have configured a simple ACL which matches traffic from a host destined to another host. If the criteria matches we have policed the traffic to 500 Mbps. 

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
ipv4 access-list acl_policing
 10 permit ipv4 host 100.57.2.2 host 100.53.2.2 <mark>police 500 mbps</mark>
</code>
</pre>
</div>

We need to enable the below hw-module profile for the compressed ACL to be configured in the ingress direction on the interface.

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
hw-module profile acl ingress compress enable
</code>
</pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
interface HundredGigE0/0/0/2
 description IXIA_2/2_Non_ETM_port
 mtu 9000
 ipv4 address 100.57.2.1 255.255.255.0
 load-interval 30
 ipv4 access-group acl_policing <mark>ingress compress level 3</mark>
</code>
</pre>
</div>

Let us verify the traffic and the router stats. From the below output we can see the received rate is 500 Mbps on the IXIA

**Ingress interface stats** 

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:N57B1-1-Vega-II5-57#show interfaces hundredGigE 0/0/0/2 | in rate
  30 second input rate <mark>9973195000</mark> bits/sec, 833322 packets/sec
  30 second output rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec
</code>
</pre>
</div>

**Egress interface stats**

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:N57B1-1-Vega-II5-57#show interfaces hundredGigE 0/0/0/8 | in rate
  30 second input rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec
  30 second output rate  <mark>498657000 </mark> bits/sec, 41666 packets/sec
</code>
</pre>
</div>


We also verify the ACL stats to verify that packets are getting dropped due to the policer. 

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:N57B1-1-Vega-II5-57#show access-lists ipv4 acl_policing hardware ingress location 0/RP0/CPU0   
ipv4 access-list acl_policing
 10 permit ipv4 host 100.57.2.2 host 100.53.2.2 police 500 mbps <mark>(Accepted: 210369109 packets, Dropped: 3997142972 packets)</mark>
</code>
</pre>
</div>
