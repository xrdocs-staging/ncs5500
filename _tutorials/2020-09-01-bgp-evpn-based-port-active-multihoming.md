## Implementation of BGP-EVPN based Port-Active Multi-Homing

In port-active multi-homing, a host/CE is multihomed to one or more Leaf/PEs and only one of the Leaf is  active and forwards the traffic to and from the connected hosts. The rest of the Leaf remain in standby mode. Thus these mode offers an active-standby PE/Leaf redundancy for multihomed host/CE.  
In this post we will cover the BGP-EVPN based Port-Active Multi-Homing of CE/Hosts. Similar to All active or Single active mode, Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) is used to identify the links towards the same multihomed Host. Port-active offers active/standby redundant connectivity with forwarding for all traffic on a single link at a time with switchover to the second link in case of active link’s failure.  Port-Active load balancing mode keeps only one link towards the host as active and rest of the link stays in LACP standby mode, thus creating a complete active standby multihoming for the connected host/CEs.  This is useful when we need protocol simplification from the host network.  

## Reference Topology

![](https://github.com/xrdocs/ncs5500/blob/gh-pages/images/evpn-config/port_active_topo.png?raw=true)

For this post, we will leverage EVPN control-plane and ISIS Segment Routing based forwarding that we configured in a [previous post]({{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/bgp-evpn-configuration-ncs-5500-part-1/). However, the choice of transport is not mandatorily ISIS+SR and we can have OSPF as IGP and LDP instead of SR as well.  


![](https://github.com/xrdocs/ncs5500/blob/gh-pages/images/evpn-config/port_active_mh.png?raw=true)

As shown in the above topology, Host-1 is multi-homed to Leaf-1 and Leaf-2. For EVPN port multi-homing, the link towards the Leaf will be a single ethernet bundle interface. This bundle may operate with different VLANs for different services. EVPN port-active mode at the leaf1 and leaf2 will elect only one leaf as the active node and the bundle on that leaf will be in active state. The bundle on the other leaf will move to standby state and signal LACP out of service towards the host. As a result all traffic from the host H-1 will be able to forward the traffic only towards the active lacp link to achieve  port active redundancy for multihoming.  The election of active Leaf is similar operation like all active DF election, however in this case the election happens based on the ethernet segment identifier.  

### Task 1: Configure Ethernet bundle on Host-1 for multi-homing
As per the reference topology Host-1 is multi-homed to Leaf-1 and Leaf-2 via LACP bundle-ethernet 1 going to both Leaf-1 and Leaf-2.  The host/CE with IP address 10.0.0.10/24 configured on a vlan sub interface on the bundle. . Following is the configuration of LAG on Host-1.
The LAG on Host-1 will come up after we configure lacp and port-active multi-homing using EVPN Ether-Segment on the Leaf-1 and Leaf-2.  

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
Host-1:

</div>
</pre>
</code>

### Task 2: Configure EVPN based port-active multi-homing

Configure Leaf-1 and Leaf-2 to provision port-active multi-homing to host-1. The set of links from Host-1 to the Leafs will be configured as the same Ethernet Segment on the Leafs. 

![](https://github.com/xrdocs/ncs5500/blob/gh-pages/images/evpn-config/port_active_mh_cfg.png?raw=true)

Configure the LACP bundles on the Leaf-1 and Leaf-2. Use below configuration for the Leafs. 

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>
Leaf-1:

interface TenGigE0/0/0/47
description "Link to Host-1"
bundle id 1 mode active
!
interface Bundle-Ether1
 description "Bundle to Host-1 for port-active"
 lacp system mac 1212.1212.1212

Leaf-2

interface TenGigE0/0/0/47
description "Link to Host-1"
bundle id 1 mode active
!
interface Bundle-Ether1
 description "Bundle to Host-1 for port-active"
 lacp system mac 1212.1212.1212
!
</div>
</pre>
</code>

Configure ESI  for the bundle interface to enable multi-homing of the host. Use the identical ethernet-segment configuration on both the Leafs. Configure load-balancing mode to port-active using “port-active” keyword for ethernet-segment. 

**Note:** `The configured ESI will be used for the selection of active port. Out of the 10 octet ESI, a modulo operation is performed on octet 3-6 to elect the active leaf/PE`

Also, verify the port-active operation making one leaf active and one leaf standby by verifying the status of the ethernet segment on each PE

**Note** `In the example shown the ethernet segment Identifier is 00.12.12.12.12.12.12.12.12.12.12 and the portion impacting DF election is 12.12.12.12 as highlighted. For Dual homing an odd-even modulo operation will gives a result of 0. Therefore Leaf1 is our active PE as it has a lower BGP router ID of 1.1.1.1 compared to 2.2.2.2 of Leaf2.`

Above output shows that the bundle interfaces are up and port active redundancy mode has created an active standby Leaf redundancy for the dual homed Host-1 . Next, lets’ provision the EVPN layer-2 service over this redundancy.

### Task 3: Configure BGP EVPN based layer-2 multipoint service

Here we will configure a EVPN layer-2 service between Leaf-1, Leaf-2 and Leaf-5 to provide a L2VPN between H1 and H5. Post configuration we will check  the status of ethernet segment. For detailed explanation of configuring BGP EVPN based layer-2 service, refer to this [post]({{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/bgp-evpn-configuration-ncs-5500-part-3/).  

![](https://github.com/xrdocs/ncs5500/blob/gh-pages/images/evpn-config/port_active_evpn.png?raw=true)

Here , the L2 service is configured on VLAN 10 (sub-interface on the bundle) and only one VPN (EVI) is shown. We may have multiple services running over different sub-interface (VLAN).

</pre>
</code>

Once , the EVPN service is up, H1 will be able to reach H5 and vice-versa. 


### Task 4: Verify that EVPN based Port-active multi-homing is operational

As we have configured the BGP EVPN layer-2 service as well as the ethernet segment, we have already verified the port active operation. Now using the same command again we can see in the service carving details and confirm that the EVPN service is only active on the active PE.

The above output on both PE shows that elected field is up only for the active PE,  although the output of both the Leafs show that both are forwarders of 1 service. Unlike All-active or Single-active, the same PE will be the elected PE for any other vlan configured on these ethernet segment. This is the nature of port active redundancy mode. To  

Ping from Host-1 to Host-5 shows that the hosts can reach each other.

Let’s now take a look at the BGP EVPN control plane by checking the types of routes received on different leaf’s. We are filtering the route for the specific PE and specific service using rd which is PE:EVI . for example , routes from leaf1 for EVI 10 will come with a RD of _**1.1.1.1:10**_

Leaf-5 also learns the MAC of host1 only via Leaf1 as it was the only active PE and there is no aliasing in port active multihoming.

Lastly, run “show evpn evi vpn-id 10 mac” command to verify the MAC address learnt for EVI 10. We see that Leaf-1 and Leaf-2 have learnt Host-5’s MAC address with Leaf-5 as the next-hop. However , Leaf5 has learnt Host-1’s MAC with only Leaf-1 as nexthop.

The above output verifies the BGP-EVPN control plane for EVPN multipoint service over Port-active multihoming. 
**Note:** `As Leaf-2 sees Host-1's MAC reachable via Leaf-1, in case of another Host/ESI connected to Leaf-2 wants to reach to Host-1 it will have to go over Leaf-1 to reach to Host-1.`

### Task 5: Configure the BGP-EVPN Distributed Anycast Gateway for IRB service

In this section we will demonstrate the Layer-3 inter-subnet routing use case over EVPN port active multihoming. Similar to Host-1’s layer-2 reachability, Host-1’s IP will also only be reachable via Leaf-1 as next-hop. After we configure BGP-EVPN distributed anycast gateway for inter-subnet routing, we will observe the routing table of Leaf-5.

![](https://github.com/xrdocs/ncs5500/blob/gh-pages/images/evpn-config/port_active_irb.png?raw=true)

Configure the BGP-EVPN Distributed Anycast Gateway on Leaf-1, Leaf-2 and Leaf-5. We will configure the IRB service over a different VLAN and show the coexistence of both service over the port active ESI. For detailed explanation of EVPN distributed anycast gateway, refer to this [post]({{site.url}}/ncs5500/tutorials/bgp-evpn-irb-configuration/).

BGP-EVPN IRB control plane can be verified by observing the route tables on the Leaf node. As we can see the route for remote host’s are learnt on Leaf1 and Leaf-5 via BGP. As Leaf-2 is in standby mode it lean’s route to  Host-1 from Leaf-1 via BGP instead of learning directly.

As of now we have configured 2 different services over the EVPN port-active multihoming and we see Leaf-1 as DF for both of this service. This is due to the fact that load balancing happens per port/ESI and the bundle on the non DF nodes are in LACP OOS status. If we see the Ethernet segment status on Leaf-1, we will see it as elected forwarder for all the configured services.

This concludes the BGP-EVPN based port-active implementation. We have shown example of both Layer2 bridging and IRB services over port-active redundancy. However, this redundancy mode can be used for any other services like layer3 or legacy layer 2. For further technical details refer to our [e-vpn.io](e-vpn.io) webpage that has a lot of material explaining the core concepts of EVPN, its operations and troubleshooting.
